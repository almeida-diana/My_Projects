Here, we are going to see two projects, one for regression and another for classification :-

1. Zomato dataset -  The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of the restaurant at different places in the world.

From all the Data available, we can bring out some neat insights such as, Which franchise has the highest number of Restaurants? or How many Restaurants are accepting online orders? or Which location has the highest number of Restaurants? And so on.

Models / methods used :-

Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Linear Regression
KNN Regressor
Linear SVM Regression
Polynomial Regression
Kernelized SVM Regression (Linear Kernel, RBF Kernel)
PCA
Bagging - Ridge, KNN
Pasting - Linear SVR, LASSO
Ada Boosting - Linear Regression, Linear SVR
Gradient Boosting - Polynomial

2. Bank Marketing dataset - To predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
