A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their business for the competitors. They need to gain an insight into who is likely to leave by analyzing their customer data.
The data set provides info in helping predict and using that information retain customers. By analyzing all relevant customer data and developing a propensity model, focused on customer retention programs you can help save the company from losing more customers and profit.
To predict the customers that are going to churn we are using a large dataset which consist of numeric and categorical variable. Models are created on the dependent variable named ‘Churn’ which is a binary variable with 0/1 representing as non-churn & churn respectively which makes this a classification problem. This project is executed with two ways, with two variants of datasets. Using this technique, we tried to achieve increased accuracy in predicting the best model.
We started with data cleaning followed by data exploration to find the correlation between the predictor variables. The next step was data splitting into training and testing data sets. We started building models using elementary techniques like Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and then built models using complex techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forest and Naïve-Bayes.
We devised a cost-assumption plan of $1 per customer for advertising. Our goal was to select the model where we need to spend the least amount to retain a customer so choosing the final model would be a trade-off decision between accuracy and cost efficiency.

By realizing how important the customer churn is in a telecom industry, this has motivated us to build a propensity model which will help us in predicting customer churn to reduce investment in advertising and thus, to retain the existing customer.
