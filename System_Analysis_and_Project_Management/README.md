ALDI ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

ALDI has been undergoing rapid change and growth in its online grocery business. During this time, ALDI has been experiencing difficulty managing its online order system as its customer base and order volume grows. Currently, ALDI is struggling with order tracking, inventory fulfillment, and meeting order delivery times and consequently is in an urgent need for a more efficient system. To this end, we are implementing an order management system that will integrate the company’s database across all sales channels and will enhance the order processes under which they operate in. Based on our analysis, an order management system(OMS) is the most suitable system for ALDI’s current needs for an E-Commerce model due to the rapid growth in online shopping. By implementing our OMS plan, ALDI will have an integrated database for order tracking information, enhanced inventory visibility and monitoring for inventory management, and greater business process performance.
