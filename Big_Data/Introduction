Accidents caused by large trucks remain one of the leading causes of injuries and deaths in the United States. 
I will use truck fleet data to refine and analyse trucking movement in order to meet the organizational goal of better understanding risk. 
The use case involves geographic data, vehicles, average mileage, gas consumption, events, risk factors, and other supporting information.
Each truck has been equipped to with devices to log location and event data. 
These events are streamed back to a datacentre where students will process the data and revise truck movements to increase safety.

The objective is identifying dangerous commercial truck drivers nationwide and answering common business questions such as,
Which truck has the highest risk factor based on geographic location and time?
