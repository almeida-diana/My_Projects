Web Scrapping is a technique of extracting information from websites using computer software or applications.
The objective of this exercise is to develop skills for acquiring data using a Python technique. 

The scraper will use Python’s BeautifulSoup toolkit to parse the site’s HTML and extract the data. 
We’ll also use the Requests library to open the URL, download the HTML and pass it to BeautifulSoup.

Here, I have performed web scraping of a weather website - https://weather.com/weather/today/l/USTX1110:1:US .
Then, formatted the data in CSV using python programming and visualized the temperature of various cities in Texas using Excel.
